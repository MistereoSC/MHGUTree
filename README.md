# MHGUTree
This repository contains the source code for my MHGUTree website. An actual weapon tree for MHGU.
<br>
The site currently supports filters to search for element type, sharpness, slots and phial/shelling type.
<br>
Currently only 10/14 weapon classes are available: This includes all Blademaster weapons minus the Hunting Horn.
<br>
Watch the site in action on my temporary [life host](https://mhgutree.netlify.app/)!

And here's an example image, of how the website looks:
